Shell scripts for automated macOS machine setup.

This project is a framework for automating the setup of a macOS machine. In order to illustrate the
potential of what this project can do, please see the companion
link:https://alchemists.io/projects/mac_os-config[macOS Config] project for details. The _macOS
Config_ project is an opinionated configuration which meets the needs of my development environment
but is also meant to serve as an example and guide for building your own personalized setup. Here is
how the two projects are meant to be used:

* *macOS* (this project) - The foundational framework for building custom macOS machine setups.
* *link:https://alchemists.io/projects/mac_os-config[macOS Configuration]* - The layer on top of
  this _macOS_ project which defines a custom machine implementation. The project is meant to be
  forked for as many custom machine setups as needed.

== Requirements

. link:https://www.apple.com/macos/macos-sequoia[macOS 15.0.0 (Sequoia)]
. link:https://developer.apple.com/xcode[Xcode]

== Setup

To install, run:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/bkuhlmann/mac_os.git
cd mac_os
git checkout 20.3.0
----

== Usage

Run the following:

[source,bash]
----
bin/run
----

You will be presented with the following options (listed in order of
use):

....
Boot:
   B:  Create boot disk.
Install:
   b:  Apply basic settings.
   t:  Install development tools.
  hf:  Install Homebrew Formulas.
  hc:  Install Homebrew Casks.
   m:  Install Mac App Store software.
   a:  Install application software.
   x:  Install application software extensions.
  df:  Install dotfiles.
  np:  Install Node packages.
  rg:  Install Ruby gems.
  rc:  Install Rust crates.
   d:  Apply default settings.
  cs:  Configure installed software.
   i:  Install everything (i.e. executes all install options in order listed).
Restore:
   R:  Restore settings from backup.
Manage:
   c:  Check status of managed software.
   C:  Caffeinate machine.
  ua:  Uninstall application software.
  ux:  Uninstall application software extension.
  ra:  Reinstall application software.
  rx:  Reinstall application software extension.
   w:  Clean work (temp) directory.
   q:  Quit/Exit.
....

Choose option `i` to run a full install or select a specific option to run a single action. Each
option is designed to be re-run if necessary. This can also be handy for performing upgrades,
re-running a missing/failed install, etc.

The option prompt can be skipped by passing the desired option directly to the `bin/run` script. For
example, executing `bin/run i` will execute the full install process.

The machine should be rebooted after all install tasks have completed to ensure all settings have
been loaded.

It is recommended that the `mac_os` project directory not be deleted and kept on the local machine
in order to manage installed software and benefit from future upgrades.

=== Boot Disk

When attempting to create a boot disk via `bin/run B`, youâ€™ll be presented with the following
documentation (provided here for reference):

....
macOS Boot Disk Setup
  1. Insert a USB drive (8GB or higher).
  2. Use Disk Utility to format as "Mac OS Extended (Journaled)".
  3. Use Disk Utility to set the schema, if available, as "GUID Partition Map".
  4. Use Disk Utility to label as "Untitled".
  5. Run this script to install the OS and create a bootable USB drive.

macOS Boot Disk Usage:
  1. Insert the USB drive, created above, into the machine to be upgraded.
  2. Reboot the machine.
  3. Press and hold the POWER key before the Apple logo appears.
  4. Select the USB boot disk from the menu.
  5. Use Disk Utility to delete and/or erase the hard drive including associated partitions.
  6. Use Disk Utility to create a single "APFS" drive.
  7. Install the new operating system.

macOS Boot Disk Recovery:
  1. Start/restart the machine.
  2. Press and hold the POWER key before the Apple logo appears.
  3. Wait for the macOS installer to load from the recovery partition.
  4. Use the dialog options to launch Disk Utility, reinstall the system, etc.
....

=== Customization

All executable scripts can be found in the `bin` folder:

* `bin/apply_basic_settings` (optional, customizable): Applies basic and initial settings for
  setting up a machine.
* `bin/apply_default_settings` (optional, customizable): Applies {mac_os_defaults_link}.
* `bin/configure_software` (optional, customizable): Configures installed software as part of the
  post install process.
* `bin/create_boot_disk` (optional): Creates a macOS boot disk.
* `bin/install_app_store` (optional, customizable): Installs macOS, GUI-based, App Store
  applications.

The `lib` folder provides the base framework for installing, re-installing, and uninstalling
software. Everything provided via the link:https://alchemists.io/projects/mac_os-config[macOS
Config] project is built upon the functions found in the `lib` folder. See the
link:https://alchemists.io/projects/mac_os-config[macOS Config] project for further details.

* `lib/settings.sh`: Defines global settings for software applications, extensions, etc.

=== Troubleshooting

* *Pi-hole*: When using link:https://pi-hole.net[Pi-hole], you might need to temporarily disable
  prior to upgrading as you might experience various errors with Apple not being able to detect an
  internet connection which prevents the installer from working.
* *Recovery Mode*: When using the boot disk and the installer fails in some catastrophic manner,
  reboot the machine into recovery mode -- pass:[<kbd>POWER</kbd>] (Silicon) or
  pass:[<kbd>COMMAND</kbd>] + pass:[<kbd>r</kbd>] (Intel) buttons -- to download and install the
  last operating system used. Alternatively, you can also use pass:[<kbd>COMMAND</kbd>] +
  pass:[<kbd>OPTION</kbd>] + pass:[<kbd>r</kbd>] (Intel) to attempt to download the latest operating
  system.
* *NVRAM/PRAM Reset*: When using the boot disk, you might experience a situation where you see a
  black screen with a white circle and diagonal line running through it. This means macOS lost or
  can't find the boot disk for some reason. To correct this, shut down and boot up the system again
  while holding down pass:[<kbd>OPTION</kbd>] + pass:[<kbd>COMMAND</kbd>] + pass:[<kbd>r</kbd>] +
  pass:[<kbd>p</kbd>] (Intel) keys simultaneously. You might want to wait for the system boot sound
  to happen a few times before releasing the keys. This will clear the system NVRAM/PRAM. At this
  point you can shut down and restart the system following the boot disk instructions (the boot disk
  will be recognized now).
* *System Management Controller (SMC) Reset*: Sometimes it can help to reset the SMC to improve
  system speed. To fix, follow these steps:
** Shut down your Mac.
** Hold down pass:[<kbd>CONTROL</kbd>] + pass:[<kbd>OPTION</kbd>] on the left side of the keyboard
   and pass:[<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>] on the right side of the keyboard.
** After seven seconds, hold down the Power button as well.
** Release all keys after another seven seconds.
** Turn on your Mac.
